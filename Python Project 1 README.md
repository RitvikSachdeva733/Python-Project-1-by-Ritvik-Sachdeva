# Python-Project-by-Ritvik-Sachdeva
This project is my first one and it is a testament to all the things I have learned till now about python as a First year BE CSE 2022 student and it includes concepts like conditionals , loops and functions.
An important feature about this project is that it uses simple and efficient commands to run .
It also helps us to understand the importantance of using menus in python .
